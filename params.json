{"name":"Ngen Framework","tagline":"Next-generation C++ framework","body":"##Ngen Framework\r\nThe Ngen Framework is a powerful object-oriented cross-platform run-time that will be supplying native C++ with many features found in high-level managed languages like C# and Java. The code base is completely written from scratch and takes advantage of the latest additions to the C++ standard (C11). The goal of the project cannot be seen clearly yet, but the plan is to provide C++ developers with a rich framework for high-performance applications.\r\n\r\nLanguages like C# and Java would be useless without their accompanying frameworks due to the virtual layers between the code and the machine. The NGEN framework will provide all the gems in huge frameworks like .NET and bring them down to the machine level where they can be useful in system development.\r\n\r\nThese features will be implemented via a series of components, and include, but are not limited to the following:\r\n\r\n* Unmanaged code reflection engine\r\n* Client-server networking\r\n* Diagnostics and testing\r\n* Scripting environment\r\n* Hardware access-layer\r\n* Content management system\r\n* Graphics and UI engine\r\n* Build system\r\n* Embedded platform build options\r\n* Database query engine","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
