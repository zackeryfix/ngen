#summary How to compile the Ngen Framework using Code::Blocks

= The tool-chain =

Considering that the project is still in it's early stages of development, we decided not to design a robust make system for compiling the libraries.  This is because we may change the overall architecture of the frameworks source-tree and package structure as more shared systems are developed.  With that said, compiling the Ngen Framework is very simple, and can be accomplished in a matter of a few minutes.

== CodeBlocks == 
To begin, you will need two things, the CodeBlocks IDE and a supported C++ compiler.  The reason we choose CodeBlocks for development is because of it being cross-platform (Linux, Windows, and Mac), and because it can easily integrate almost all modern compilers into it's build system.

To download CodeBlocks, please see their download page [http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads here] and download the package for your platform (without MingW if using Windows).

== GCC == 
While that is downloading or installing, you will need to download a supported compiler, which is simple because we currently only support GCC version 4.8 or higher. 

=== Windows === 
If your using Windows, you will need to download the latest TDM-GCC package for your processor architecture from [http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download here] and install it.  

Make sure the TDM-GCC binaries are in your PATH environment variable after installation.

=== Linux === 
If you are using Linux, 'gcc' should be installed.  You may check the version by running:
{{{
~$: gcc --version
}}}
If version 4.8 or higher is not installed, please refer to your distrobutions package manager to acquire the latest version or upgrade the current 'gcc' package.

== Subversion == 
We are using SVN for our code repositories, so you will need to download the latest subversion package for your platform.  

=== Windows === 
If using Windows, we suggest downloading TortoiseSVN from here.  Its very clean and simple to use. 

=== Linux ===

=== Checking out ===
